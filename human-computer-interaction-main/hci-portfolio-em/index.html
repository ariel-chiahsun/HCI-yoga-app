            Y360 is an augmented reality (AR) yoga app designed to provide immersive 360° video courses, offering new experiences for yoga practitioners. With the recent pandemic, the way people learn yoga has changed dramatically, resulting in an increasing number of individuals opting for home-based yoga practice instead of attending physical classes. Y360 aims to address the challenges of remote yoga learning by introducing an interactive learning environment that offers personalized training courses using action-recognition systems.
            <br> The main contributions of the project are summarized as follows:
            <ul>
                    <li>Created an AR interface that utilizes 360° video technology to simulate the feeling of attending physical yoga classes</li>
                    <li>Integrated action-recognition technology to provide real-time feedback and improve users' posture and technique</li>
                    <li>Created personalized training courses that adapt to the user's skill level and meet their individual needs</li>
     
                  </ul>

              <h2>User Interview</h2>
              <p>
                  To gain insights into our target users and address key pain points, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five students from National Taiwan University who had practiced yoga consistently for over a year. Our focus was on understanding their experiences, needs, and expectations of yoga.
              <h3>We found out that......</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Verbal guidance was as effective as hands-on guidance for learning yoga</li>
                    <li>Real-time feedback was desired to bring attention to body mechanics during practice</li>
                    <li>Personalized learning experiences and ownership of practice space were expected</li>
                    <li>The yoga studio was viewed as a place for learning and mutual support among students</li>
                  </ul>
                  
              </p>
             
              <div id='product positioning'>
                <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                     After conducting a thorough analysis of competitors, we identified two main areas that require improvement: personalized courses and a holistic view of yoga positions. Specifically, we looked into two types of competitors: yoga apps and virtual reality yoga games. One of the limitations we found with current products is that they offer limited courses and restrict user choices. Additionally, most yoga app videos only provide side and front views of instructors demonstrating poses. 
                </p>
                <h3>To differentiate ourselves, our objectives are to</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Provide both pre-designed and customized courses, allowing users to plan their workouts</li>
                  <li>Integrate AR technology to create an immersive experience, where users can explore yoga poses further through rotating and zooming 360° interactive videos</li>
                  <li>Enhance the real-time feedback system, allowing users to reflect on their performance and improve in future classes</li>
                </ul>

            To create a learning environment that addresses these user needs, we have developed four product design guidelines:
            <ul>
                <li>Provide clear and sufficient demonstrations with verbal instructions</li>
                <li>Offer real-time feedback to correct errors and improve performance</li>
                <li>Allow users to create custom yoga sequences based on their preferences</li>
                <li>Create a platform for learners to share their experiences and connect with others</li>

          <div id='prototyping'>
              
              <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype Design</h2>
              <p>After conducting user research and competitive analysis, we prioritized four key sections for our product: Explore, My Courses, My Profile, and Community. 
                These sections address the needs of our target users and provide a better user experience (UX). 
                Using sketching techniques, we designed the UX based on the guidelines we proposed for creating an ideal learning environment for yoga practitioners. </p>

              <h2>High-Fidelity Prototype Design</h2>
              <p>To add personality to our product and connect with users, we used UX writing to craft the text copies that appear throughout the interface of our prototype. </p>
              <h3>Flexible and Customizable Yoga Journey from the Start</h3>
              <p>Our onboarding process allows users to set preferences for content and training levels, and provides the option to set daily reminders. This approach creates a customizable and flexible yoga journey from the outset.</p>

                Throughout my participation in this human-computer interaction project, I had the opportunity to work alongside a diverse team with varying backgrounds, including business, computer science, psychology, and humanities. While the design-thinking process presented its challenges, it was also invigorating to approach technology design with a human-centric focus that prioritized user needs. Collaboration was key to our success, and working with people from diverse backgrounds provided me with a unique perspective on how interdisciplinary efforts can lead to innovative outcomes. This experience reinforced the idea that technology can play a valuable role in helping people, while also improving my communication and critical thinking skills by challenging my assumptions.
